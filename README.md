**Microsoft Small BASIC**  

-----

Microsoft Small BASIC, is a quite simply SUPERB IDE/Integrated Development Environment...for teaching people who are 'new' to learning programming how to code, effectively.

-> The program is entirely FREE to download  
-> The download comes with an instructional file: ISB/Introducing Small BASIC [.pdf]  
-> There is built-in intellisense with automatic code completion   
-> You're allowed to have multiple programs open all together at once inside of the IDE   
   (though, you can only run one program a time)  
-> It includes the use of LOGO turtle graphics (very simple and easy to set up/use with just a few lines of code)  
-> Uses Flickr photos API-Application Programming Interface to change background desktop pic  
-> Allows you to 'upload' code you've written by publishing it online for others to see/share/play with  
-> Allows you to 'download' others code...in order to run it/and, play games...or, just in order to learn/see how it's done  
-> Plus, there is a 'ton' of really helpful resources out there in the form of: books/web sites/videos/-etc.    

**SUMMARY**: QBASIC, was a 'stand alone' program; and, in that sense it's 'old'; you needed a manual to use it. Small BASIC, on the other hand, is truly the face of 'modern day' computer programming; in that it reaches out towards the internet where you can 'share' codes instantly with others -(through upload/download)- to both copy and learn from. This means, you don't really need to use any manual; instead, just simply hack others code...download it, first...test that it works by running it; then, make modifications of your own to change it...re-run to see if those changes work...or, if the code breaks; save others work with a slightly different name...downloaded name: prog1/saved changes name: prog1b/prog1c...as each change/test goes along; and, in this way you learn.
